    "## Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All below methods is BPE-based tokenizer, but the training approach `(e.g, WordPiece: merge/ Unigram: split)`, the way to treat character `(e.g, Wordpiece: , Sentencepiece: including \"_\")` and the way to build initialized vocabulary are diffrerents. Moreover, these tokenizers are dependent on training dataset, language-specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Byte-level BPE\n",
    "A base vocabulary that includes all possible base characters can be quite large if e.g. all unicode characters are considered as base characters. To have a better base vocabulary, GPT-2 uses bytes as the base vocabulary, which is a clever trick to force the base vocabulary to be of size 256 while ensuring that every base character is included in the vocabulary. With some additional rules to deal with punctuation, the GPT2‚Äôs tokenizer can tokenize every text without the need for the <unk> symbol. GPT-2 has a vocabulary size of 50,257, which corresponds to the 256 bytes base tokens, a special end-of-text token and the symbols learned with 50,000 merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WordPiece\n",
    "WordPiece is the subword tokenization algorithm used for BERT, DistilBERT, and Electra. The algorithm was outlined in Japanese and Korean Voice Search (Schuster et al., 2012) and is very similar to BPE. WordPiece first initializes the vocabulary to include every character present in the training data and progressively learns a given number of merge rules. In contrast to BPE, WordPiece does not choose the most frequent symbol pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unigram\n",
    "Unigram is a subword tokenization algorithm introduced in Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation Models with Multiple Subword Candidates (Kudo, 2018). In contrast to BPE or WordPiece, Unigram initializes its base vocabulary to a large number of symbols and progressively trims down each symbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and the most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but it‚Äôs used in conjunction with SentencePiece.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SentencePiece\n",
    "All tokenization algorithms described so far have the same problem: It is assumed that the input text uses spaces to separate words. However, not all languages use spaces to separate words. One possible solution is to use language specific pre-tokenizers, e.g. XLM uses a specific Chinese, Japanese, and Thai pre-tokenizer). To solve this problem more generally, SentencePiece: A simple and language independent subword tokenizer and detokenizer for Neural Text Processing (Kudo et al., 2018) treats the input as a raw input stream, thus including the space in the set of characters to use. It then uses the BPE or unigram algorithm to construct the appropriate vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XLNetTokenizer uses SentencePiece for example, which is also why in the example earlier the \"‚ñÅ\" character was included in the vocabulary. Decoding with SentencePiece is very easy since all tokens can just be concatenated and \"‚ñÅ\" is replaced by a space."
